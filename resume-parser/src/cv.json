When we consider dealing with operating system structures as objects, we see that it greatly helps to implement the desired modularity in these systems. The purpose of this article is to present an object-oriented design for a feedback process scheduler that runs on user mode. The authors show the details of the original structured implementation, the new pro-posed design, and show the adopted mechanism to interface the new scheduler and the other servers or even the kernel.\n\nVol. 11 No. 08\nIssue 08/2017 (96)\nISSN 1898-9144"
